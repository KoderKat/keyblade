# KeyBlade: A Fanfiction Knowledge Base

## Installation

The KeyBlade backend software is written in Python. The scrapers depend on [scrapy](http://scrapy.org); the classifier (Auto-Rating Classifier) depends in [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org); and the GUI depends on [PyQT](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro).

To install KeyBlade, clone the repository and run setup.py from the top directory.
